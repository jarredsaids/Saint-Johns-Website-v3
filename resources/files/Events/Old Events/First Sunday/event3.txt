First Sunday
May 7
5:00PM
First Sunday is May 7th. We will gather in fellowship hall from 5 to 6 pm for a casual, relaxed hour of eating, singing, reading scripture and praying to connect and grow as a community. Bring your favorite bible, sandwiches for your family and a few to spare. St. John's is providing chips and soft drinks.
